# Adhoc test

This test doesn't do anything particular - it's basically just a scratchbook to test any recent changes, so feel free to modify it however you want.

NOTE: If you're using Tilt then any changes to files within the `models/` folder will automatically trigger a call to the refresh script, otherwise you'll have to do it manually (because Meson is [pathetically stupid](https://github.com/mesonbuild/meson/issues/2320) with how it let's you generate files).
